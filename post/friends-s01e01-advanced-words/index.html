<h2 id="albino-coca-12k">albino (COCA 12k)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;albino&rdquo; refers to a person or animal with a condition called albinism, which is characterized by a lack of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. This results in very light skin, white or pale hair, and eyes that can appear pink or blue due to the visibility of blood vessels. In the context of the sentence from &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; it describes a person with these physical traits¹.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple explanation in English:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Albino</strong>: A person with very pale skin, white hair, and light-colored eyes due to a lack of pigment.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how you might explain it in Chinese (since your system settings indicate a preference for Chinese):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>白化病人</strong>：由于缺乏色素，皮肤非常苍白，头发白色，眼睛颜色浅，通常呈粉红色或蓝色。</li>
</ul>
<p>This condition is not just a human trait; animals can be albinos too. The term can also be used as an adjective to describe organisms with this condition¹.</p>

<h2 id="aromatherapy-coca-10k">aromatherapy (COCA 10k)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>And then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Aromatherapy” refers to a holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts, particularly essential oils, to promote health and well-being. It can involve the inhalation or bodily application (such as by massage) of these oils for therapeutic purposes. The goal is often to enhance both physical and emotional health12.
In the context of the “Friends” episode, the character is likely suggesting that they found comfort or relief through aromatherapy, implying that it helped them understand and manage their feelings better. It’s a way of saying that aromatherapy brought them a sense of well-being and they can empathize with what someone else is going through because of it.
If you need the explanation in Chinese, here it is: &ldquo;芳香疗法&quot;指的是一种整体治疗方法，它使用天然植物提取物，特别是精油，来促进健康和幸福感。它可以涉及吸入或身体应用（如通过按摩）这些油以达到治疗目的。目标通常是同时增强身体和情感健康12。
在《老友记》第一季第一集的上下文中，角色可能是在暗示他们通过芳香疗法找到了安慰或缓解，意味着它帮助他们更好地理解和管理自己的感受。这是一种说法，芳香疗法给他们带来了幸福感，并且他们可以因为它而同情别人的经历。</p>

<h2 id="freaked-coca-11k">freaked (COCA 11k)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I got really freaked out, and that&rsquo;s when it hit me:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;freaked out&rdquo; means to become very scared, anxious, or overwhelmed by emotions. It&rsquo;s often used to describe a strong, immediate reaction to something unexpected or frightening¹. In the context of the sentence from &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; it suggests that the character experienced a sudden and intense feeling of fear or worry, which led to a moment of realization or an important thought.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple explanation in English:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freaked out</strong>: Feeling very scared or overwhelmed by strong emotions.
And here&rsquo;s how you might explain it in Chinese, as your system settings indicate a preference for Chinese:</li>
<li><strong>吓坏了</strong>：感到非常害怕或被强烈的情绪压倒。
This expression is commonly used in everyday English to describe a state of shock or panic. If you have any more questions or need further explanations, feel free to ask!</li>

<h2 id="geeky-headword-geek-coca-12k">geeky (Headword: geek) (COCA 12k)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I figured you thought I was Monica&rsquo;s geeky older brother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;geeky&rdquo; is an informal adjective used to describe someone who is very interested in and knowledgeable about a particular subject, especially in science or technology. It can sometimes imply that the person is not fashionable or socially adept¹. In the context of &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; when Ross says he thought he was seen as Monica&rsquo;s &ldquo;geeky older brother,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s suggesting that he was perceived as somewhat socially awkward and intensely interested in academic or intellectual pursuits, rather than being &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or socially skilled.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple explanation in English:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geeky</strong>: Having an interest in specific, often niche topics, and being very knowledgeable about them, sometimes to the point of being socially awkward.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how you might explain it in Chinese, as your system settings indicate a preference for Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>书呆子气的</strong>：对特定（通常是小众的）话题非常感兴趣并且非常了解，有时到了在社交上可能显得有些笨拙的程度。</li>
</ul>
<p>This term is often used in a light-hearted or affectionate way, especially in modern contexts where being knowledgeable about tech and science is generally seen as a positive trait. If you have any more questions or need further explanations, feel free to ask!</p>

<h2 id="horny-coca-11k">horny (COCA 11k)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m hungry or horny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context, the word &ldquo;horny&rdquo; does not refer to being interested in gardening or having horns. In this case, it&rsquo;s a more vulgar way of saying someone is feeling sexually aroused.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown to understand it better:</p>
<p>Horny: This word has a different meaning depending on the context. In general conversation, it can refer to being very enthusiastic or eager about something. However, when used alone, as in this sentence, it refers to sexual arousal.</p>
<p>Sexually Aroused: This means someone has a strong desire for sexual activity.</p>
<p>Understanding the Context:
In Friends, which is a sitcom known for its innuendo and suggestive humor, the character is likely trying to be funny by using a more crass term to express feeling indecisive between hunger and another biological urge.</p>

<h2 id="mittens-headword-mitt-coca-10k">mittens (Headword: mitt) (COCA 10k)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;mittens&rdquo; refers to a type of glove that covers the entire hand but does not have individual finger openings, except for the thumb which is in a separate part¹. They are typically worn in cold weather to keep hands warm. In the context of the song lyrics from &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;something with mittens&rdquo; likely refers to a cozy, wintery scene where mittens are a common accessory.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple explanation in English:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mittens</strong>: Gloves that cover the hand and have one section for the thumb and another section for the other four fingers together.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how you might explain it in Chinese, as your system settings indicate a preference for Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>连指手套</strong>：一种手套，覆盖整个手部，但没有单独的手指开口，除了拇指有一个单独的部分。</li>
</ul>
<p>Mittens are often associated with winter activities and are designed to provide warmth by keeping the fingers close together, which helps to retain heat. If you have any more questions or need further explanations, feel free to ask!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;sleigh&rdquo; refers to a large sled that is typically used for traveling over snow and ice. It is often pulled by animals, especially horses. In the context of the song lyrics from &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;sleigh bells&rdquo; likely refers to the jingling bells that are commonly associated with the harnesses of horses pulling a sleigh, evoking a wintery, festive atmosphere¹².</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple explanation in English:</p>
